Problem Statement and Methodology  In the Speaker Recognition problem, we are provided with a dataset comprising speeches of prominent personalities in the form of .wav files. Besides, a background noise audio file has also been given, which can be intertwined with the speech audios to ensure better results. Here, our objective is to train a model with the best possible accuracy that can correctly predict the speaker of the speech; thus, it is an Audio Classification problem.
